We don't advertise S3/S4 support by default since RHEL6.2:

RHEL6.4 has S3/S4 advertisement disabled by default (can be overriden by
    the disable_s3 and disable_s4 properties of the PIIX4).
RHEL6.3 and 6.2 had S3/S4 advertisement disabled by default (can be
    overriden by using the alternative bios-pm.bin SeaBIOS image).
RHEL6.1 and 6.0 had S3/S4 advertisement enabled by default.

We need to ensure we keep that behaviour, so adjust the 6.1 and 6.0
machine types to allow S3/S4.

As a side note, migrating a RHEL6.0 or RHEL6.1 VM to a RHEL6.2 or 6.3
host would have caused a guest-visible change, but we can do better
starting with 6.4, so let's do the right thing now.  This, however, has
the potential to cause two guest-visible changes if a VM is migrated
like this:

RHEL6.1 host --1--> RHEL6.3 host --2--> RHEL6.4 host

After (1) above, guest will stop seeing S3/S4 advertised.  After (2),
S3/S4 will be advertised again.
